# renewable-energy-livelihoods
A community-driven initiative focused on empowering women and youth through renewable energy solutions, training, and sustainable livelihood opportunities.
# Project Plan: Renewable Energy Livelihoods

## 1. Project Overview
The **Renewable Energy Livelihoods** project is a community-driven initiative that empowers women and youth by providing access to clean, affordable renewable energy solutions. By integrating training, innovation, and entrepreneurship, this project seeks to improve household energy access while creating sustainable livelihood opportunities.

## 2. Objectives
- Expand access to renewable energy technologies (solar, biogas, clean cooking solutions).
- Build skills through community training on installation, maintenance, and entrepreneurship.
- Create green jobs and income streams linked to renewable energy value chains.
- Reduce dependence on unsustainable energy sources like firewood and charcoal.
- Promote environmental conservation and climate resilience.

## 3. Problem Statement
In many underserved communities, including refugee settlements and rural areas, access to reliable energy is limited. Women and youth face barriers to economic opportunities, while reliance on firewood contributes to deforestation, health risks, and climate change. There is a critical need for renewable energy interventions that support both **livelihoods** and **sustainability**.
